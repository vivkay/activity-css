    <h1>Ugly Dolls – A $100 Million Empire</h1> 
    
    
    <h2>A Romantic Start</h2>
    <p>In late 2001, <em>David Horvath</em> signed a letter to his college sweetheart, <em>Sun-Min Kim</em>, with a drawing of a wide-eyed monster with long arms, stubby legs, fangs and a giant head.
</p>    
    
     <p>Ms. Kim turned the artwork into a plush doll, and Mr. Horvath showed it to a friend who owned a Los Angeles toy store. Orders from more toy stores began trickling in, and by the end of 2002, sales were outpacing the couple's ability to keep up.
